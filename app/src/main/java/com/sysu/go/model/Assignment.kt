/**
 * Represents a single shipment assignment for a driver.
 *
 * Used in the multi-shipment dashboard tabs (MainActivity) and the
 * Assignment screen (My Trip). One per sap_assignments document.
 *
 * @param docId  Firestore document ID of the sap_assignments entry — used as shipment number
 * @param queueId  Firestore document ID of the linked queue entry
 * @param driverId  Firebase UID (from queue.driverId or session)
 * @param status  Queue status: waiting / called / assigned / loading / in_transit
 * @param tripStatus  Trip status from sap_assignments: null / in_transit / completed
 * @param plateNumber  Resolved plate number (queue or sap field)
 * @param truckType  From queue.truckType
 * @param helper  From queue.helper / queue.helperName
 * @param guardVerified  True after guard signs and submits verification
 * @param guardFirstName  Guard's first name (populated after verification)
 * @param guardLastName  Guard's last name (populated after verification)
 * @param deliveryTimestamp  actualDelDate from sap_assignments (ms)
 * @param obdCount  Number of line items
 * @param requirements  Map of requirement keys → boolean (from drivers/{driverId}/requirements)
 * @param shipmentNumber  Display alias — returns obdNumber if set, else docId fallback
 * @param obdNumber        OBD number from sap_assignments.data.obdNumber — used in card subtitle
